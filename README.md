# Formula Sheets

This repository contains formula sheets (cheat sheets) for the EE and CS courses I took at UC Berkeley. The formula sheets may not contain the most up-to-date materials.

So far there is just one giant PDF containing all the formula sheets, I will classify them and put them into separate PDF soon!

I hope this is helpful and if you have any question please feel free to reach out to me at shun.lin@berkeley.edu.
